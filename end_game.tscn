text = "At long last, you stand atop the Ninth Circle, the infernal climb complete. The final step echoes through the void, a sound that marks the end of your journeyâ€”or the beginning of something far greater.

The darkness, once oppressive, now bends to your will. The demon that hunted you is no more, banished by your defiance and strength. The cursed clock, your constant companion, now lies still, its power spent, its purpose fulfilled.

Ahead, the throne of the damned awaits, a seat of power for those who would rule over the abyss. The whispers of the fallen souls grow quiet as you approach, their cries of torment now replaced by a reverent silence.

\"You have ascended,\" the voice from the void intones, now filled with a grim respect. \"You have conquered the nine circles and overcome the trials that would break lesser souls.\"

And now, a choice lies before you. Will you claim dominion over the darkness, ruling as master of this forsaken realm? Or will you shatter the chains that bind you and seek the light once more, leaving the abyss behind?

The throne stands empty, awaiting your decision. But whatever path you choose, know this: You have faced Hell itself, and you have emerged victorious."
